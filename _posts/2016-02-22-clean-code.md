### Introduction
> Writing clean code is what you must do in order to call yourself a **professional**. 
> There is no reasonable excuse for doing anything less than your best.

 
> LeBlanc’s law: **Later equals never**.

![productivity vs. time]

> Every change they mak to the code breaks two or three other parts of the code.

Adding new staffs not necessary means it can solve problem.


> Spending time keeping your code clean is not just cost efective, it’s a matter of professional suvival. 

> it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don’t understand the risks of making messes.

> I like my code to be **elegant** and **efficient**
> 
> <cite>- Bjarne Stroustrup</cite>

> Clean code:

> - pleasing to read
> - exhibits close attention to detail
> - does one thing well
> - is focused

> Clean code is **simple** and **direct**. Clean code read like **well-written prose**. Clean code **never obscures** the designer’s intent but rather is full of **crisp abstractions** and **strightforward** lines of controls.
> 
> <cite>- Grady Booch</cite>

> Think back on a really good book that you’ve read. Remember how the words disappeared to be replaced by images!

A really  good book I ever read - “Javascript the good part”

> Our code should be matter-of-fact as opposed to speculative. It shuld contain nly what is necessary. Our readers should perceive us to have been decisive.

I think writing good codes is like writting a good thesis. 

> Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. It **has unit and acceptance tests**. It has **meaningful names**. It provides one way rather than many ways for **doing one thing**. It has **minimal dependencies**, which are explicitly defined, and provides a **clear and minimal API**.
> 
> <cite>- Dave Thomas</cite>

But do remember code with tests doesn’t imply the code itself is clean.
